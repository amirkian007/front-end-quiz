# Declarative Quiz

## Description

Here, we have a quiz form to guess the capital city of Iran. The code for the form is located in `App.vue`. It appears too imperative. Rewrite the code to be as <ins>**declarative**</ins> as possible.

## Getting started
```bash
#install pnpm globally if not installed
npm i pnpm -g
#install packages
pnpm i 
#run the dev server on local host
pnpm run dev
```
